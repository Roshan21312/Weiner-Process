# Weiner Process Random Walk Simulation

## Description

This project provides a Python implementation of a Weiner Process, also known as Brownian motion or random walk. 
This simulation is used to model random movements over time, which is a fundamental concept in stochastic processes. 
It has applications in various fields such as finance, physics, and mathematics.

## Features

- Simulates a Weiner process (Brownian motion).
- Generates random walk data points using normal distribution.
- Visualizes the random walk using `matplotlib`.
- Allows customization of parameters like the number of steps and time intervals.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: `numpy`, `matplotlib`

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```
Code Explanation:-
Initialization: We Set up parameters for the Weiner process such as the number of steps and the time interval.
Random Walk Generation: Used a normal distribution to simulate the random walk.
Plotting: We are using "matplotlib" to visualize the generated random walk.
